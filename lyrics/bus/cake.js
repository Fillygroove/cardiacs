		"Rip open packets and read before using",
		"Open up math book your sanity\'s losing",
		"Hard slappy thing in your hand, it’s amusing",
		"You stab and you’re sick, Uncle Bimbo is oozing",
		'<i>[Tim Smith]</i>',
		"Everyone’s looking and everyone’s trying their best to see over the top of me",
		"Over and under the weight of the world is too much because everyone laughs at me",
		'<i>[Michael Pugh]</i>',
		"You bit me, I’m bleeding, my artery's severed",
		"Please lock me up, don’t you know I deserve it?",
		"My mummy told me that nurses are smashing",
		"But teachers are nasty, they need a good thrashing!",
		"(Ha ha ha!)",
		'<i>[Tim Smith]</i>',
		"Everyone’s looking and everyone’s trying their best to see over the top of me",
		"Over and under the way of the world is too much because everyone laughs at me",
