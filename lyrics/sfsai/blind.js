		"Death a thing she hardly knew",
		"So thin and rare and small and few",
		"It smells just like me",
		"And it smells just like you",
		"She's blinded for the best",
		"In this bright tree she makes her nest",
		"Everyone laughs as she struggles up high",
		"Everyone's happy and she wants to die",
		"(There I see)",
		"Dead is and so far everything is new",
		"It smells just like me",
		"And it smells just like you",
		"Blind in safety and leafy in love",
		"Plain ugly and homely race",
		"With sad disgrace drawn on its face",
		"She sleeps in the buds in a place",
		"Where no summer shines no tears are shed",
		"For the living or for the dead",
		"Even love can't tell her anything",
		"When there's blubs in her eyes shine with formaldehyde",
		"Cries with a different feeling",
		"When the chaos ensues with a new appetite",
		"And in the wormless sand shall she",
		"A feast for no foul glutton be",
		"She's washed by the sea to a place",
		"Where no summer shines no tears are shed",
		"For the living or for the dead",
		"Blind in safety and leafy in love",
