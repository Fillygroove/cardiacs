		'Images of them coming up to me and I hear them say',
		'But what they say don\'t matter anyway',
		'Easy come easy go I know it well that is',
		'So pressures building bound to give',
		'Although I might be wrong',
		'Run out of words to say on the train',
		'You came up here in the rain and back again for',
		'a while smile at me and one day we\'ll see',
		'What is seeing is believing though what I\'m seeing',
		'I don\'t believe but you know I might be wrong',
		'Cold as can be in an English sea',
		'Oh to be beside the sea',
		'Oh can\'t we beside the seaside',
		'Happens over and over again',
		'Happens over and over again',
		'Knock at the door hello come inside for a word',
		'or maybe a cup of tea would be nice oh',
		'I\'ll make a pot do stay',
		'Ant and Bee and the ABC',
		'cold as can be in an English sea',
		'And everything it\'s ever meant to me',
		'Well that\'s great coming from you seeing as how',
		'It\'s you who makes the world go round as we all know',
		'See the light shine above you see the light shine',
		'Around you sunshine everywhere you go',
		'And I ask for information concerning',
		'The duty to that concerns you',
		'And you laugh at me I ask you is it true',
		'That are four of you to every one of me',
		'Turning round again all the time',
		'You pass me in the rain how are you today',
		'It\'s a Toy World',
		'It\'s a Toy World',
		'It\'s a Toy World',
		'It\'s a Toy World',
