		'Uh oh, icky qualms',
		'I\'m getting sick of just sitting around',
		'Cause you think that by keeping me I\'m safe and sound',
		'You wrap me up and you keep me warm',
		'But you think I\'ve just been fucking born',
		'You don\'t realize that was quite some time',
		'I\m old enough now to be set free',
		'Cause I tell them I\'m a man but they don\'t believe me ',
		'Cause I tell them I\'m a man but they don\'t believe me ',
		'My mum\'s obscene, My Dad\'s obscene',
		'the vicar\'s obscene, OH GOD',
		'I tell them I\'m a man but they don\'t believe me ',
		'I tell them I\'m a man but they don\'t believe me ',
		'I tell them I\'m a man but they don\'t believe me ',
		'I tell them I\'m a man but they don\'t believe me ',
		'But if I\'m still here in the morning',
		'They banned the bomb and the war on want',
		'And they banned Richard Davis they won\'t allow the rabies',
		'As far as I\'m concerned that\'s a load of bull',
		'I know I\'m a rebel what I need is a cause',
		'But if I\'m still here in the morning',
