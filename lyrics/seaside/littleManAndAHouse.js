		"Leaving early, just before the hour",
		"A few moments won't make any difference",
		"Not to me, anyway",
		"The early bird catches the worm",
		"I don't really want to go in tomorrow",
		"The man will tell me off for leaving early yesterday",
		"Close your eyes dear, never mind",
		"And there's voices inside me",
		"They're screaming and telling me;",
		"\"That's the way we all go\"",
		"There's thousands of people just like me all over",
		"But that's the way we all go",
		"What can I do, when everyones been so helpful",
		"How can I have the right to say",
		"I'm different to you?",
		"(Oh......)",
		"But I'm lost not for words or for kindness or sympathy",
		"That's the way we all go",
		"And if you're bigger you fall a bit harder",
		"But that's the way we all go",
		"There's a pain in my side it's a lesson I learned from a while ago",
		"(That's the way we all go)",
		"I'll be screaming inside I'll be biting my nails but it won't show",
		"(That's the way we all go)",
		"There's a knock at my door as I fall to the floor but I still don't know",
		"(That's the way we all go)",
		"That the people outside shed a tear for my pride but they still won't go",
		"(That's the way we all go)",
		"Why should I think I'm alone the whole factory thinks;",
		"\"That's the way we all go\"",
		"Then there's Washington, Tokyo, New York and Moscow",
		"But that's the way we all go",
		"They're all crying and arguing down the telephone",
		"But that's the way we all go",
		"Then there's me standing here with my whole life to spare",
		"That's the way we all go",
		"That's the way we all go",
		"That's the way we all go",
		"That's the way we all go",
		"That's the way we all go",
		"It's easier when you know how obviously but that's how it goes",
		"(That's the way we all go)",
		"Look at me now I know something that you don't 'cos",
		"That's the way we all go",
		"The turning wheel reeks of the whale and the whaler",
		"But that's the way we all go",
		"The early bird catches the worm does the worm think that",
		"That's the way we all go?",
